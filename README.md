We are creating plant life support system to improve crew's health and productivity during the Mars trip. Our system is
a transformable external module, during the flight it can be extended. During the returning from Mars crew will use
100% of the system power, but on the way to the Mars they will need only 30%. Our module allows to avoid taking
additional space, it will take only as much as required for the current period. This makes our system comfortable and
effective in use.

Watering plants as well as using a lot of substrate is known to be problematic in space conditions. We suggest to use
improved Hydroponic Drip System to deliver water specifically to each plant's root. This will be achieved by using Soft
Tube robots that will deliver solution of minerals directly to the root. Otherwise, there is a risk that plants will
not receive required water and substances.

Referring to the previous experience of NASA, to grow plants inside a starship we also need sensors. We will control
humidity, temperature, CO2, O2, pressure, ethylene. In addition to that, air circulation system will be used

As a source of light we are using LED strips, that are built into the roof of the module. Plants need full spectre of
colours but the most effective is 450 nm and 640 nm waves, according to NASA

Internal surfaces will be created using polymers, so it will be easy to clean them.

Water circulation will be closed. Extra humidity will be collected from air and used to water plants.

LED strips will raise temperature inside the module, so if necessary, cooling system will be activated.

Gases will also be controlled. This will solve problem that plants have different gas exchange rate during their life
