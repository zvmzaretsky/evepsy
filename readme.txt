===== EVEPSY =====

Space greenhouse project

The device is designed for growing plants in space. The 
module can either be attached to the ISS or be used 
separately on other planets or satellites, such as the Moon. 
A special camera, with the help of a software and hardware 
complex, maintains the microclimate and lighting at a 
satisfactory level for plant growth.

How to run a project:
  1. You need to install Arduino IDE and unpack 
     the libraries into the "libraries" folder.
  2. Open the file "EVEPSY" in Arduino IDE.
  3. Select a board in the board manager in the 
     context menu at the top of the window
  4. Press the "Load" button in the context 
     menu at the top of the window.

Connect the sensors to the microcontroller pins:
  DHT11/DHT22 - D2
  FAN MOSFET  - D8
  LED MOSFET  - D9
  HUMIDIFIER  - D7
